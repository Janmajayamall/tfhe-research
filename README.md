# TFHE

Ever wondered what's T-FHE? Dig into the repository to learn how to implement it yourself. Also, find the implementation details under notes.

The plan is to put all TFHE related useful papers (& notes) and their easy to understand implementations at one place in this repository.

If you ever wondered how to have fully homormoprhic arithmetic & relation operations, what's look up, what's programmable boostrapping, how efficient is TFHE, what are different tricks, and what's feasible to implement? Stay tuned for more info!

> [!WARNING]
> This is very much a work in progress. Implementation in this repository isn't perfect and I enourage you to open PRs. If you find a something not typical please feel free to discuss.
